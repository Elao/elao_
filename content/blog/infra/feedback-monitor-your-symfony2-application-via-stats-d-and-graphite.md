Few times ago, I wrote two articles on how to monitor your Symfony2 application via Stats.d and Graphite (<a title="Install Stats.d / Graphite on a debian server in order to monitor a Symfony2 application (1/2)" href="/en/infra/install-stats-d-graphite-on-a-debian-server-to-monitor-a-symfony2-application" target="_blank">part 1</a> / <a title="Monitor your Symfony2 application via Stats.d and Graphite (2/2)" href="/en/infra/monitor-your-symfony2-application-via-stats-d-and-graphite-2" target="_blank">part 2</a>).

Although I specifically said that you should be running your graphite environment on another server, I choose not to follow my own advise  (« do what I say not what I do »).

This mini article purpose is to give you some feedback about running your monitoring system on the same server that you monitor.
Long story short : **DON'T**.

My server is an Intel Xeon 4 Core (4 x 2,4 Ghz) 8 Go DDR3 2 x with 500 Go SATA Raid 1 Hard.

Running graphite + carbon + stats.d on my production server was **eating up to 95% i/o disk utilisation** resulting in slow response time for my webserver, slow operations which required disk usage...

Once I realized that my monitoring system was the problem (especially carbon), I decided to shut it down. The difference was clearly visible. From 95% I/O disk usage to 0-1%.

**I won ~60%** on my server response time (both monitored by google analytics and newrelic).
